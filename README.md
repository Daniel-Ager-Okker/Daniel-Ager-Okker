- 👋 Hi, I’m @Daniel-Ager-Okker
- 👀 I’m interested in python, especially in data science and machine learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently working in service company as an hydrodynamic modeling engineer.
- 💞️ In particular, my job implies well data analysis and sometimes there could be a lot of information. So i think it is a good idea to use data science's instruments in the working process.
